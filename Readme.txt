Scala Chess

This is a hacked Scala version from the excellent series of videos at HaskellLive.com, @haskelllive on twitter.
A basic attempt at copying what that series is doing but in Scala. Adapted from the Haskell.org Chess tutorial.

Get in touch if you're interested in setting up a parallel ScalaLive equivalent for pedagogical / fun purposes.
